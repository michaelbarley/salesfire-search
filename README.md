## Introduction
üëãüèª Hey! I have successfully developed the solution for the task outlined. 
Here's a brief overview of the key steps I took:

1. **Vue Project Creation and Repository**: I set up a new Vue application using the `Vue CLI` and initialized a Git repository for version control.

2. **Installing and Setting Up Vuex**: I installed `Vuex`, a state management library, and organized the store into modules for better structure and maintainability.

3. **Component Creation**: I created two Vue components, `SearchBar` and `ResultsSet`, to handle the search functionality and display the results.

4. **Debouncing**: I implemented debouncing in the `SearchBar` component using the `Lodash` debounce function to optimize the search input and prevent excessive API calls.

5. **Vuex Store and API Integration**: I integrated API calls into the Vuex store, sending GET requests to the Salesfire API with the necessary parameters. The search action updates the state with the search results.

6. **Error Handling**: I implemented error handling in the search action to catch and display any API errors that occur during fetching.

7. **Responsive Design and CSS Clean-up**: I utilized CSS Grid for the layout of the results, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. I followed BEM methodology for clean and organized CSS styles.

## Getting Started
To run and test the Vue SearchBox application locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

`Node.js`

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd vue-searchbox
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Running the Application
1. Start the development server:

```arduino
npm run serve
```

This will compile the project and launch a development server. You will see the local server address (e.g., http://localhost:8080) in the terminal.

Open your web browser and visit the provided local server address (e.g., http://localhost:8080). The Vue SearchBox application should now be running.
